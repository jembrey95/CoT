# CoT
Cost of Thinking experiment One N-back.</br></br>
The first CoT experiment using a N-back task.
Largely a replica of Westbrook et al. (2013) only with the inclusion of a 0-back task (where participants press 'm' every trial).
Additionally, titration in COG-ED discounting task starts with both options offered for equal money (allowing preference for harder option for equal (or less) money).
